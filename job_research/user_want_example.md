# Instructions for Describing What You're Looking For

This file should clearly describe your job search preferences and requirements. Be specific but concise. Below is an example structure you can follow:

# What I'm Looking For

Describe your ideal job situation, including:
- Employment type (full-time, part-time, contract, freelance)
- Programming languages you want to work with
- Role focus (frontend, backend, fullstack, DevOps, etc.)
- Industry preferences or specific domains of interest
- Any special requirements or preferences

## Example:
```
I am seeking a full-time position as a Python developer, primarily focused on backend development. 
While I'm comfortable with full-stack work, my passion lies in building robust backend systems.

Key preferences:
- Python as primary language, with openness to Go or Java
- Backend-focused role (80%+ backend work)
- Opportunity to work on data processing or API development
- Interest in companies working with AI/ML, though not required
- Remote work preferred, but open to hybrid in the Boston area
- Collaborative team environment with mentorship opportunities

Deal-breakers:
- No pure frontend roles
- No extensive travel requirements
- No startups in pre-seed stage
```

Note: Be honest about your preferences but remain somewhat flexible. Too many strict requirements might limit your opportunities.
